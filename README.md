# Finetuning_Korean-Chinese-LLM
A Large-scale Language Model, fine-tuned to prioritize literary qualities in translations between Korean and Chinese, emphasizing emotional depth and stylistic nuances over literal word-for-word translation. 
The goal is to produce translations that reflect the original's tone, style, and emotional depth, ensuring that literary and expressive aspects are conveyed effectively. And the model will focus on delivering translations that are not only accurate and rich in literary expression but also as natural as human translations.
